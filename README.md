üì± Responsive travel blog with dynamic page and data + API requests to display temperature dynamically.

üå° Throughout the site, via the header, we follow the real time temperature of the latest travel's location. <br>
üè° The latest blog post is featured at the top of the homepage. Previous articles are accessible at the bottom.<br> 
üõ´ By clicking on the images, the user is redirected to the next page with trip's specs.<br>
üß© They are divided into following sections :
* The trip
* Traveler's review: 
    * Positives points  
    * Negatives points  
    * Advices

## üöÄ About Me
I'm currently studying full stack web development, and for my homework, I had to create an app based on a Figma mockup. I needed to use my own data, like pictures and text, to build the user interface for the application. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
